# Hotel-Management-System-SQL-Java
The project uses a Microsoft Access database to manage a hotels client infromation. The infromation stored is first name, last name, address, city, state, check in data, check out date, room style, and room type. The program allows a user to check in or check out to the hotel and updates the database using SQL. The java part of the project creates the gui and methodology to be pasted to the SQL side of the database. 

In order to use the project properly the file name/address should be change to fit the user's location for the database.
